# play-frontend-govuk-examples

This repo is a dependency for the Google Chrome extension [play-frontend-govuk-extension](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk-extension).

The extension provides extra widgets for [design-system.service.gov.uk/components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/).
Currently, this webpage acts as a manual for using GovUK components with HTML and Nunjucks examples.

The extension pulls in the Scala Twirl examples provided by this repo (translated from the Nunjucks examples).
This allows it to add an extra tab to each set of examples for using the Scala Twirl implemented by [play-frontend-govuk](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk)

## Prerequisites
First start up the `x-govuk-component-renderer` NodeJS service according to the ReadMe in the relevant GitHub repo.

## Testing
Run the unit tests and ensure they pass before committing new changes by the below command:
```
sbt test
```

## Interface for Chrome extension
The [play-frontend-govuk-extension](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk-extension). repo traverses the directory structure of this repo published at [raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

To do this, it uses two URLs:
1) Examples root URL - the URL corresponding to the root directory for all Scala Twirl component example directories
2) Manifest URL - the URL for a manifest JSON file providing the URLs relative to the Examples root URL for each Scala Twirl component example.

Note that if the location of the root directory where Scala Twirl examples can be found or the manifest file, is changed; the corresponding update is needed in [play-frontend-govuk-extension](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk-extension).
Such changes will be breaking changes for the extension, and users will need to re-download the latest version of the extension source code.

## Regenerating examples and committing changes

Update the dependencies to play-frontend-govuk and play-frontend-hmrc by updating the
playFrontendGovukVersion and playFrontendHmrcVersion vals in
 [project/LibDependencies.scala](project/LibDependencies.scala)

Twirl examples are generated by translating the Nunjucks examples from the govuk-design-system and the hmrc-design-system for govuk-frontend and hmrc-frontend
components appropriately.

References to these repositories are stored in the form of git submodules.
You will want to first ensure these submodules are the latest available by the below command: 
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd govuk-design-system
git checkout master
git pull
cd ..
cd hmrc-design-system
git checkout master
git pull
cd ..
```

Alternatively, you can do this via an sbt task, which runs as a prerequisite to example generation:
```sbtshell
sbt updateExampleSources
```

The examples can be regenerated by running the below:
```sbtshell
sbt generateExamples
```

If any Scala Twirl examples are added or removed , the manifest JSON file will need to be regenerated too.
This can be done by running the below:
```sbtshell
sbt generateExamplesManifest
```
As a result, `manifest.json` would be amended - commit changes to both examples and the manifests to master when changes are ready to be deployed.

Re-run the tests for each version of Play:

```
PLAY_VERSION=2.5 sbt test && PLAY_VERSION=2.6 sbt test && PLAY_VERSION=2.7 sbt test
```

### Generating & testing Example Templates
The examples need to be unit tested against the expected output `HTML` accompanying each example in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/)
to ensure the `Twirl` examples produce the same markup as the `Nunjucks` ones. <br/>
**_`Todo`_**: Use GET from /examples-output/$$COMPONENT_NAME$$ endpoint call in [x-govuk-component-renderer](https://github.com/hmrc/x-govuk-component-renderer) to retrieve html equivalent and compare

Once the examples have been created, an `sbt` task is manually run to generate a [manifest.json](src/test/resources/manifest.json)
file that is consumed by the [Chrome extension]((https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk-extension)) to display the examples
in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/).

Ideally the following processes would be automated and wired up to run as a single process:
1. Generate the examples from the `Nunjucks` automatically (DONE)
2. Write automated tests using html from Template Service (DONE)
3. Generate the `manifest.json` for the `Chrome` extension (DONE)

With the Template Renderer running locally, run the integration tests:

```
sbt it:test
```

The above tests will ensure the output from the Twirl examples matches the HTML
on the GOV.UK and HMRC design system websites.

### Integration testing

(1) Get Nunjucks example from design system website
(2) Parse example
(3) Generate Twirl example
(4) Check the Twirl example compiles and run some basic tests sbt test
(5) Render Twirl example (using version of hmrc-frontend specified in dependencies)
(6) Go to component renderer to get the equivalent Nunjucks example
(7) Component renders Nunjucks example (using version of hmrc-frontend specified in the design system)
(7) Compare HTML output
